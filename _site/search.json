    "text": "Summary\nThis thesis defines ecoregions within the Benguela Eastern Boundary Upwelling System based on the intensity and frequency of upwelling. It then analyzes the impact of these ecoregions on biological productivity, specifically focusing on:\n\nKelp Abundance: Investigating how kelp abundance varies across the different upwelling-defined ecoregions. The goal is to identify which regions exhibit the highest kelp abundance.\nChlorophyll-a (Phytoplankton Abundance): Examining the relationship between the upwelling ecoregions and phytoplankton abundance, as indicated by chlorophyll-a concentrations.\n\nThe research aims to understand how physical oceanographic features (upwelling) structure the ecosystem and influence the distribution of key primary producers like kelp and phytoplankton.\n\n\n\n\nPhD Research Timeline\n\nDefine Ecoregions: Analyze upwelling data (SST) to define distinct ecoregions within the Benguela EBUS.\nAnalyze Kelp Abundance: Investigate the relationship between the defined ecoregions and kelp abundance. Determine which ecoregions have the highest kelp abundance.\nAnalyze Chlorophyll-a Abundance: Investigate the relationship between the defined ecoregions and chlorophyll-a abundance (phytoplankton).\nSynthesize Findings: Synthesize the results from the kelp and chlorophyll-a analyses to understand the broader ecological consequences of the upwelling-defined ecoregions.\n\n\n\n\nIdeas for Research Questions and Objectives\nHere is a list of potential research questions and objectives that could be explored within the scope of this PhD project. These are designed to be of a narrower scale than the main research question and could potentially form the basis of individual data chapters.\n\nResearch Question 1: Temporal Dynamics of Upwelling Characteristics\nQuestion: How have the key characteristics of upwelling events (frequency, intensity, duration) changed over the past 40 years within each of the defined ecoregions of the Benguela system?\nObjectives:\n\nTo develop a robust methodology for identifying and characterizing individual upwelling events from the 40-year SST dataset.\nTo quantify and compare long-term trends and inter-annual variability in upwelling frequency, intensity, and duration for each ecoregion.\nTo investigate potential correlations between these trends and large-scale climate indices (e.g., Southern Annular Mode, El Niño-Southern Oscillation).\n\n\n\nResearch Question 2: The Spatio-Temporal Response of Kelp to Upwelling\nQuestion: What is the temporal lag between upwelling events and the response of kelp abundance, and how does this relationship vary spatially across the different ecoregions?\nObjectives:\n\nTo perform a time-series analysis to determine the characteristic time-lag between upwelling events (of varying intensity/duration) and the peak response in kelp abundance.\nTo compare this time-lag across the different upwelling-defined ecoregions to see if the kelp populations in different areas have different response times.\nTo develop a predictive model for kelp abundance based on preceding upwelling conditions for each ecoregion.\n\n\n\nResearch Question 3: Phytoplankton Bloom Dynamics and Upwelling Thresholds\nQuestion: Is there a minimum threshold of upwelling intensity or duration required to trigger a significant phytoplankton bloom (as measured by chlorophyll-a concentration)?\nObjectives:\n\nTo model the relationship between upwelling characteristics and chlorophyll-a concentrations.\nTo explicitly test for a non-linear relationship or a “tipping point” where a small change in upwelling leads to a large change in chlorophyll-a.\nTo analyze how this threshold may vary seasonally or across the different ecoregions.\n\n\n\nResearch Question 4: Investigating a Kelp vs. Phytoplankton Trophic Interaction\nQuestion: Is there evidence of competition for nutrients or a synergistic relationship between near-shore kelp forests and offshore phytoplankton populations following upwelling events?\nObjectives:\n\nTo investigate the correlation between kelp abundance and chlorophyll-a concentrations in the months following major upwelling events, controlling for the intensity of the upwelling.\nTo explore whether years with high kelp abundance correspond to years with lower (or higher) than expected phytoplankton biomass, given the upwelling conditions.\n\n\n\nResearch Question 5: The Impact of Extreme Climatic Events\nQuestion: How do extreme climatic events, such as marine heatwaves or anomalous upwelling conditions (e.g., a prolonged absence of upwelling or a season of exceptionally intense upwelling), impact the resilience and recovery of kelp forests and phytoplankton populations?\nObjectives:\n\nTo identify and categorize extreme events within the 40-year oceanographic dataset.\nTo analyze the corresponding changes in kelp and chlorophyll-a abundance during and after these events.\nTo quantify the recovery time for both kelp and phytoplankton to return to a pre-event baseline state.\n\n\n\nResearch Question 6: The Stability of Ecoregion Boundaries\nQuestion: Do the spatial boundaries of the upwelling-defined ecoregions exhibit significant seasonal or inter-annual shifts, and if so, how do these shifts correlate with broader climate patterns?\nObjectives:\n\nTo map the spatial extent of the defined ecoregions for each year and/or season in the 40-year dataset.\nTo analyze the variability of these boundaries and test for correlations with climate indices like ENSO.\nTo consider the implications of shifting ecoregion boundaries for the long-term monitoring of kelp and phytoplankton.\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nUpwelling - sea surface temperature (SST) data over a period of approx. 40 years will be used to determine upwelling trends along the west coast of southern Africa (talk to Tom)\nData Products:\nSST - Coarse resolution projects are lightweight to download and plot: OISST and KelpWatch. Better resolution for final product: OSTIA/MUR/etc.\nKelp - AJ has access to approx. 40 years of kelp biomass and/or abundance data that I can use to correlate with upwelling\nPhytoplankton - will have to find chlorophyll-a data that matches spatially and temporally"
