## On this site

The centralized site for oceanographic and statistical content curated by MSc student Jesse Phillips. The connected pages contain past and current projects, blog posts and tutorials.

NB UPDATE: This website will be overhauled and repurposed for my PhD (and beyond) research...big things incoming \[31/01/2026\].

### Projects

Here is where I will upload past and current research on oceanographic and statistical topics.

### Blogs

Interesting things I come across that I would like to speak on.

### Tutorials

Instructional pieces on how to accomplish various tasks I've come across, will probably include some or other coding.
