I created this website as a personal project. A place to upload all the of oceanographic work that I've been doing - while also testing some coding skills I've been working on. Over the course of 2025, I hope to develop this into a full portfolio of my Masters research on fluctuating ocean temperatures and extreme events.

2026 Update: Make that a PhD portfolio, hosted on Posit Connect Cloud (or the like).
